# Business Justifications

Virtual directories:

- Allow us to create multiple directories within the server and assign different permissions to each of them
- Ensuring that only authorized users have access to certain areas
- Justification: As our website will have different areas that are only meant to be accessed by certain users (e.g. account management and order tracking pages), virtual directories will allow us to segregate these areas and assign the appropriate permissions to each of them. This will ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and that the website is secure.

Virtual servers:

- Allow us to host multiple websites on a single physical server, each with its own unique domain name
- Useful if we decide to expand our online business in the future
- Justification: Virtual servers will allow us to host multiple websites on the same server, which will be useful if we decide to expand our online business in the future. This will save us the cost and resources of setting up a separate server for each new website we create.

PHP:

- Programming language used to create dynamic web pages that can retrieve and display data from a database
- Allows us to create an interactive website that can respond to user requests and provide personalized content
- Justification: PHP will allow us to create a dynamic and interactive website that can respond to user requests and provide personalized content. This will improve the user experience and make our website more engaging for customers.

MySQL:

- Popular database management system used to store and retrieve data for our website
- Keep track of customer information, product listings, and order histories
- Justification: MySQL will allow us to store and retrieve data for our website efficiently. It will be used to keep track of customer information, product listings, and order histories, which will be essential for running our online business smoothly.

HTTP authentication:

- Protect certain areas of the website with a login system
- Ensures that only authorized users have access to certain areas
- Justification: HTTP authentication will allow us to protect certain areas of the website with a login system, ensuring that only authorized users have access to these areas. This will be important for areas of the website that contain sensitive information, such as the account management and order tracking pages.

SSL certificates:

- Secure the connection between the server and the client
- Protect data from being intercepted by third parties
- Justification: SSL certificates will ensure that all data transmitted between the server and the client is encrypted, protecting it from being intercepted by third parties. This is important for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers' information.

CGI applications:

- Run scripts on the server to generate dynamic content, such as interactive forms
- Justification: CGI applications will allow us to run scripts on the server to generate dynamic content, such as interactive forms. This will be useful for creating interactive features on the website, improving the user experience.

PHP applications:

- Create more advanced features on the website, such as user accounts and order tracking
- Justification: PHP applications will allow us to create more advanced features on the website, such as user accounts and order tracking. These features will provide a more seamless experience for customers and allow them to easily manage their accounts and orders.
